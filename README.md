## Azure data lake storage Gen1 to Gen2 Migration sample

Welcome to the documentation on migration from Gen1 to Gen2. Please review the [Gen1-Gen2 Migration Approach guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-migrate-gen1-to-gen2) to understand the patterns and approach. You can choose one of these patterns, combine them together, or design a custom pattern of your own.

You will find here the resources to help with below patterns:

1. **Incremental copy pattern** using **Azure data factory**

   Refer [Incremental copy pattern guide](https://github.com/rukmani-msft/adlsgen1togen2migrationsamples/blob/master/src/Incremental/README.md) to know more and get started.

2. **Bi-directional sync pattern** using **WANdisco Fusion**

   Refer [Bi-directional sync pattern guide](https://github.com/rukmani-msft/adlsgen1togen2migrationsamples/blob/master/src/Bi-directional/README.md) to know more and get started.
   
3. **Lift and Shift pattern** using **Azure data factory**

   Refer [Lift and Shift pattern guide](https://github.com/rukmani-msft/adlsgen1togen2migrationsamples/blob/master/src/Lift%20and%20Shift/README.md) to know more and get started.
   
4. **Dual Pipeline pattern** 

   Refer [Dual pipeline pattern guide](https://github.com/rukmani-msft/adlsgen1togen2migrationsamples/blob/master/src/Dual%20pipeline/README.md) to know more and get started.
